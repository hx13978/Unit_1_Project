# Unit_1_Project
Attched it the completed HTML, CSS, and Javascript for an interactive Self-scoring Trivia website developed by a beginner programmer. The game will preload with ten questions and answers and then test the user's animal knowledge once they click the start button. At the end of the ten questions, they will be provided a score and offered to try the trivial game again.

# Instructions
Upon loading the website, the user will be provided with a set of directions stating they will be asked ten questions pertaining to the trivia category of animal groups. In addition, the user will be informed to click on the "Start" button to begin the game.  Once the game is started one trivia question will appear at a time on the screen until an answer is selected. When an answer is selected, the game will go to the next question and will continue in a loop through all ten questions, and then end with a page informing the user of their score and if they would like to "try again". If the user clicks on the "try again" button, the trivia game will reload with the first trivia question. Enjoy the game!

# Prerequisites
- HTML
- CSS, Responsive Web Design
- Javascript

# Next Steps
One improvement would be to shuffle the question sequence each time the game is played.

Another next step to improve the player's experience would be to have them compete against other players using a high-score board. In addition, add a timing feature to settle a winner if multiple players have the same high-score.
